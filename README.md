# 📱 Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning  

This project shows how to build a simple **spam message detector** using Python and Machine Learning.  
It uses a dataset of real messages to train a model that can tell whether a message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  

---

## 🎯 What this project does
1. Loads a dataset of messages (spam vs. ham/normal).  
2. Converts the text messages into numbers that a machine learning model can understand.  
3. Trains a **Naive Bayes Classifier**, a popular algorithm for text classification.  
4. Lets you type in your own message and see if it’s **spam** or **not spam**.
